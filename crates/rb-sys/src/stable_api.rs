//! Stable ABI functions which provide access to Ruby internals that
//! is compatible across Ruby versions, and are guaranteed to be not break due
//! to Ruby binary changes.
//!
//! ### Goals
//!
//! 1. To provide access to Ruby internals that are not exposed by the libruby
//!    (i.e. C macros and inline functions).
//! 2. Provide support for Ruby development versions, which can make breaking
//!    changes without semantic versioning. We want to support these versions
//!    to ensure Rust extensions don't prevent the Ruby core team from testing
//!    changes in production.
