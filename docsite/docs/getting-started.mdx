# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through creating a new Ruby gem with a Rust extension using `rb-sys`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following installed:

- **Ruby** (2.6+): [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
- **Rust** (1.65+): [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **Bundler**: `gem install bundler`

## Create Your Gem

The easiest way to get started is by using the built-in `bundle gem` command with the `--ext=rust` option. This will generate a complete gem skeleton with a Rust extension ready for you to start building.

```bash
# Create a new gem with a Rust extension
bundle gem --ext=rust my_gem
cd my_gem
```

This will create a new directory called `my_gem` with the following structure:

```
my_gem/
├── Gemfile              # Ruby dependencies
├── my_gem.gemspec       # Gem metadata
├── Rakefile             # Build tasks
├── ext/my_gem/          # Rust extension
│   ├── Cargo.toml       # Rust dependencies
│   ├── extconf.rb       # Build configuration
│   └── src/
│       └── lib.rs       # Rust code
└── lib/
    └── my_gem.rb        # Ruby wrapper
```

## Build and Compile

To compile the Rust extension, you can use the provided Rake task:

```bash
# Install dependencies and compile the extension
bundle install
bundle exec rake compile
```

This will:

1.  Install any Ruby dependencies from the `Gemfile`.
2.  Run the `extconf.rb` script, which creates a `Makefile` for building the Rust extension.
3.  Compile the Rust code in `ext/my_gem/src/lib.rs` into a shared library.
4.  Copy the compiled library into the `lib/my_gem/` directory, so it can be loaded by Ruby.
