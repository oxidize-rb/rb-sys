# Frequently Asked Questions

Answers to common questions about building Ruby extensions with Rust.

## General

### Q: When should I use Rust for a Ruby extension?

**A:** Use Rust for CPU-bound, memory-intensive, or security-sensitive tasks, or for wrapping existing Rust libraries. See [Development Approaches](./development-approaches.mdx).

### Q: Is Rust harder to learn than C for writing gems?

**A:** Rust has a steeper initial learning curve due to ownership rules, but its compiler prevents bugs common in C extensions.

### Q: Will my code be faster?

**A:** Rust extensions can be 10-100x faster for CPU-intensive tasks. However, FFI overhead can make simple operations slower. Always profile first. See [Performance](./performance.mdx).

### Q: Will a Rust extension work with Rails?

**A:** Yes. A Rust-based gem functions like any other gem and can be used within a Rails application.

## Technical

### Q: How do I debug my extension?

**A:** Compile with debug symbols and use `gdb` or `lldb`. See [Debugging](./debugging.mdx).

### Q: How do I distribute my gem to users?

**A:** Ship pre-compiled ("fat") gems for common platforms to avoid requiring users to install Rust. See [Deployment & Distribution](./deployment.mdx).

### Q: How do I handle panics?

**A:** Avoid panics; they crash Ruby. Functions should return `Result<T, magnus::Error>` to convert Rust errors into Ruby exceptions. See [Error Handling](./error-handling.mdx).

### Q: Why is my extension slower than I expected?

**A:** This often results from "chatty" calls across the Ruby-Rust boundary. Pass collections to Rust for iteration instead of many small calls. See [Performance](./performance.mdx).

## Troubleshooting

### Q: I'm getting "undefined symbol" errors.

**A:** Ensure your Rust function is marked `#[magnus::init]` or `#[no_mangle] pub extern "C" fn Init_my_gem()`, `crate-type` is `["cdylib"]`, and names match `extconf.rb`.

### Q: The build is failing with a "libclang not found" error.

**A:** `rb-sys` uses `bindgen`, which requires `libclang`. Add `gem "libclang"` to your `Gemfile`, or install `libclang` via your system package manager (e.g., `brew install llvm`, `apt-get install libclang-dev`).
