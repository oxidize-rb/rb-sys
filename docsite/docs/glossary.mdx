# Glossary

Quick reference for terms used throughout rb-sys documentation.

## A

**ABI (Application Binary Interface)**
: The low-level interface between compiled code and the system. Defines how functions are called, how data is represented in memory, etc.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
: The high-level interface for using a library or system. In rb-sys context, refers to Ruby's C API or Magnus's Rust API.

**Arity**
: The number of arguments a function accepts. In Ruby, this determines how Magnus registers methods.

## B

**Bindgen**
: A Rust tool that automatically generates FFI bindings from C header files. Used by rb-sys to create Ruby C API bindings.

**Borrowing**
: Rust's mechanism for temporary access to data without taking ownership. Prevents data races at compile time.

**Build Script (build.rs)**
: Rust code that runs before compilation. Used to configure the build process, generate code, or link to external libraries.

## C

**C API**
: Ruby's native extension interface, written in C. Provides functions for creating Ruby objects, calling methods, etc.

**Cargo**
: Rust's package manager and build tool. Similar to Bundler for Ruby.

**Cargo.toml**
: Rust's project configuration file. Specifies dependencies, metadata, and build settings.

**cdylib**
: A type of Rust library that produces a C-compatible dynamic library. Required for Ruby extensions.

**CFG**
: Conditional compilation in Rust. Allows code to be included/excluded based on configuration.

**Crate**
: A Rust package or library. Can be published to crates.io.

## D

**DataTypeFunctions**
: Magnus trait for defining how Ruby's GC interacts with Rust structs. Includes marking and deallocation.

**Drop**
: Rust trait for cleanup when a value goes out of scope. Similar to Ruby's finalizers but deterministic.

## E

**extconf.rb**
: Ruby script that configures extension compilation. Creates a Makefile for building native extensions.

**Extension**
: Native code (C, Rust, etc.) compiled into a shared library that Ruby can load.

## F

**FFI (Foreign Function Interface)**
: Mechanism for calling functions across language boundaries. How Rust calls Ruby's C API.

**Feature Flags**
: Compile-time options in Rust. Enable/disable functionality or dependencies.

## G

**GC (Garbage Collector)**
: Ruby's automatic memory management system. Cleans up unused objects.

**Gem**
: Ruby package format. Can include pure Ruby code and/or native extensions.

**Gemspec**
: Ruby gem specification file. Defines metadata, dependencies, and files.

**GVL (Global VM Lock)**
: Ruby's Global VM Lock (also called GIL). Prevents true parallelism in Ruby threads.

## I

**Interior Mutability**
: Rust pattern allowing mutation through shared references. Often uses `RefCell` or `Mutex`.

## L

**Lifetime**
: Rust's way of tracking how long references are valid. Prevents use-after-free errors.

**Link-Time Optimization (LTO)**
: Optimization across compilation units. Can significantly improve performance but increases build time.

## M

**Magnus**
: High-level Rust library for Ruby extensions. Provides safe, ergonomic API over rb-sys.

**Makefile**
: Build instructions generated by extconf.rb. Used by Ruby to compile extensions.

**Marking**
: Process of telling Ruby's GC about references from Rust to Ruby objects. Prevents premature collection.

**mkmf**
: Ruby's makefile generator library. Used by extconf.rb.

## O

**Ownership**
: Rust's memory management model. Each value has one owner, and is freed when the owner goes out of scope.

## P

**Panic**
: Rust's unrecoverable error. Should be avoided in Ruby extensions as it can crash Ruby.

**Platform Triple**
: Target specification like `x86_64-apple-darwin`. Identifies CPU architecture, vendor, and OS.

## R

**rb-sys**
: Low-level Rust bindings to Ruby's C API. Foundation for building Ruby extensions in Rust.

**rb_sys gem**
: Ruby gem that helps compile Rust extensions. Companion to the rb-sys crate.

**RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**
: Pattern where resource lifetime is tied to object lifetime. Used extensively in Rust.

**Rake**
: Ruby's build automation tool. Similar to Make but written in Ruby.

**RefCell**
: Rust type providing interior mutability with runtime borrow checking.

**Result**
: Rust's error handling type. Either `Ok(value)` or `Err(error)`.

**RSTRING**
: Ruby's internal string representation. Accessed through rb-sys for zero-copy operations.

**Rustup**
: Rust toolchain installer and version manager.

## S

**Segfault (Segmentation Fault)**
: Memory access violation causing program crash. Rust helps prevent these.

**Symbol**
: Ruby's immutable string identifiers. Often used as hash keys or method names.

**Static**
: In Rust, either compile-time constants or values that live for the program's lifetime.

## T

**Target**
: Platform being compiled for. Can cross-compile for different targets.

**Trait**
: Rust's interface mechanism. Defines shared behavior across types.

**TypedData**
: Ruby's way of wrapping C/Rust structs with type information and GC integration.

## U

**Unsafe**
: Rust code that bypasses safety checks. Required for FFI but should be minimized.

## V

**VALUE**
: Ruby's generic object type in the C API. Represents any Ruby object.

## W

**Workspace**
: Cargo feature for managing multiple related packages. Shares dependencies and build cache.

**Wrapper**
: Code that provides a higher-level interface over low-level functionality.
